# Blush Blush Cheat
A cheat made for the Steam version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/777130/Blush_Blush/">Blush Blush

Check out my cheat for <a href="https://github.com/Omega172/Crush-Crush-Cheat">Crush Crush

The key to show/hide the GUI is "Insert"

# How to use

1. Download and install the dependencies listed in the README, restart PC after installing dependencies.
2. Either compile the DLL or download the compiled one from [Releases](https://github.com/Omega172/Blush-Blush-Cheat/releases/latest).
3. Using a DLL injector of your choice Inject the DLL into BlushBlush.exe.

For a DLL injector, if you are very new to this I recommend [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)
